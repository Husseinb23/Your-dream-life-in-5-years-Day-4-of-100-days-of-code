# Sneaky Extra Skill

You can jazz things up even more by changing the color of the text. Wow. We're quickly approaching the quality of output of a computer from 1981! ðŸ˜¬

## How does it work?

- It's all just `print` statements, but using special codes that tell your console to start printing ***everything after this point*** in the new color.
- You will need to reset if you want to go back and change it in previous lessons.

- The somewhat random characters in the print argument are telling the computer to change the color of the next text output to whichever color you pick.
- You must add the number from the table below.

&nbsp;

| Color   | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Default | 0     |
| Black   | 30    |
| Red     | 31    |
| Green   | 32    |
| Yellow  | 33    |
| Blue    | 34    |
| Purple  | 35    |
| Cyan    | 36    |
| White   | 37    |

## Example

<details><summary>Something like this would allow you to have a red `warning` in the middle of the output.</summary>

```python
print("Uh, oh, you've been given a", "\033[31m", "warning", "\033[0m", "for being a bad, bad person.")
```
</details>

### Use that to add **extra spice** to your authorial masterpiece!
